Installing TrMPS
================

TrMPS requires Python â‰¥ 3.5, numpy, TensorFlow, and more (depending on the datasource used). The package will be hosted on PyPI at some point soon, at whcih point installation should get a lot easier. For now, to replicate results, it is probably easiest to just clone the repo and use that.
